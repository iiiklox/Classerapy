# Classerapy, an unofficial  Classera API

A python unofficial API library for Iraq's Classera schooling platform.


# What exactly can this do?

This is a library used to communicate with https://classera.com 's servers directly within your project using the power of Python!

### how to use:
1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the repository into your workspace/project directory.
3. Install the `requirements.txt` file for dependencies, run:
	```cmd
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
And  go crazy! the package contains an `example.py` file, we don't offer documentation for the time being.

### TODO:
```
- Implement exceptions handler.
- Implement objects.
- Implement sockets for real time messages.
- Implement a whole bunch of missing functions.
```
